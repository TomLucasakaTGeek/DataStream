# AI-Enhanced Sustainability Data Platform

Welcome to the **AI-Enhanced Sustainability Data Platform**, a project designed to process real-time environmental data (like carbon emissions), detect anomalies using artificial intelligence, and deliver actionable insights via REST APIs. This project demonstrates a modern, scalable approach to sustainability analytics, leveraging object-oriented design, microservices, and cloud-native technologies. Whether you're a beginner or a technical expert, this README will guide you through what the project does, how it’s built, and how to get it running.
